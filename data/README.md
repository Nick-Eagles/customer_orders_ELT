Datasets were sourced from [this data warehouse project](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main/datasets), including several raw tables about a business' customers, products, and orders.

The two example sources `CRM` and `ERP` provide several tables with a small but excellent example of messy, real-world data.
